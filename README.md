this is jp--, a language built by me which may or may not end up being okay :/ now with the addition of an accomplishment tracker: 

can parse values

binary expressions

order of operations

multiple datatypes

keyword support

binary operations

working interpreter

variables

also removed null type from frontend and made it in runtime

added boolean, but no operations yet

can assign values to variables and declare if they are constant or not

file execution
